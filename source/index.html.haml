        %h1 THE HUMIDITY'S NOT TOO BAD
        %h2 We are Code Park, a group of Houston developers joining forces to create welcoming environments for anyone to learn to code for the web. Our mission is to increase developer diversity in our community so we can grow stronger.

        %h3 Merge
        %p Let our forces combine! We are here for beginners all the way to experienced. By joining up we can help reduce simple things like meeting conflicts, but also increase the number of new initiatives from a bigger pool of volunteers.

        %h3 Pair
        %p Find other developers to work with on fun projects. What better way for beginners to keep on going than to have friends working with them? Experienced developers can also benefit from working with other developers outside their skillset or by volunteering to run beginner workshops.
